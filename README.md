<h1>ShopSmart Ecommerce System</h1>
ShopSmart Ecommerce System is a machine learning project that can determine whether a visitor is likely to make a purchase based on their session behaviour. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis(EDA), applying appropriate feature preprocessing and transformations, and developing a Decision Tree based classification model.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul><li>shop_smart.ipynb – Model for training and evaluation</li></ul>
<ul><li>shop_smart_ecommerce.csv – Dataset used for training and evaluation</li></ul>

<h2>Models Used</h2>
<ul><li>Decision Tree</li></ul>
Model performance was compared using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

<h2>Model Comparison</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Model</th><th>F1-Score (%)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Decision Tree</td>	<td>62.78</td></tr>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul><li>Python</li></ul>
<ul><li>Pandas, NumPy</li></ul>
<ul><li>Scikit-learn</li></ul>
<ul><li>Jupyter Lab</li></ul>

<h2>Future Work</h2>
<ul><li>Deploy the final model using Streamlit</li></ul>
<ul><li>Improve feature engineering</li></ul>
<ul><li>Add model interpretability and UI enhancements</li></ul>

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>
During this project, I learned and applied several important machine learning and data preprocessing concepts, including:
<ul><li>Determining whether a visitor is likely to make a purchase based on their session behaviour</li></ul>
<ul><li>Encoding categorical variables using <b>OneHotEncoder</b> based on feature type</li></ul>
<ul><li>Performing exploratory data analysis(EDA), applying appropriate feature preprocessing and transformations, and developing a Decision Tree based classification model</li></ul>
<ul><li>Understanding the impact of feature scaling using <b>StandardScaler</b></li></ul>
